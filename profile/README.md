# Röltgen Lab – Virus Immunology (VIM)
_From infection to protection: Investigating immune responses to viruses and vaccines_  

The Röltgen Lab, based at the Swiss TPH in Basel, investigates how the immune system responds to viral infections and how those responses can be leveraged to develop better diagnostics and vaccines.

### 🧬 Research Focus  
- B cell and antibody responses to human coronaviruses in Africa — e.g., the **COROVIA** project, tracking SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses longitudinally.
- Development of tools for rapid detection of both past and present coronavirus infections, combining immunological assays with molecular diagnostics.

- Prof. Dr. Katharina Röltgen – Principal Investigator
- Martin Monteil-Ruiz – PhD student  
- Salomé Lochmann – Pre-PhD student
- Kai Wanner – MSc student 
- Nema Ahmed Alfaki – MSc student
